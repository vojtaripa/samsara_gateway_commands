Gateway Command Override with additional commands

Just wanted to share a tool with everyone that I've been working on.

It enhances the functionality of the gateway command page:

example:
https://cloud.samsara.com/o/39846/devices/212014918687023/command

I have added few additional functions that you can run (so you dont have to remember the commands) and I would like to keep adding more to this so please provide feedback!

The page will look like this:

I have attached a "how to" video.

Here are the links you will need:

1. Tampermonkey extension (to run the code) -https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
2. Gateway Command Script I wrote (GitHub) -https://github.com/vojtaripa/samsara_gateway_commands/blob/main/tampermonkey_script
3. Sample Gateway Page - https://cloud.samsara.com/o/39846/devices/212014918687023/command

Please let me know what you think and if you find this helpful.
